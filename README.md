# Ambassador Transportation Website Redesign

## Project Summary

### Selected Website
The website chosen for redesign is [Ambassador Transportation](https://ambassadortransportation.net).

### Why the Client Needs a New Website
- **Purpose of the Website**: The primary goal is to provide potential clients with an easy-to-navigate platform to explore transportation services, request quotes, and make bookings.
- **Target Audience**:
  - Business professionals needing corporate transportation.
  - Tourists seeking reliable airport and event transportation.
  - Event organizers looking for group transport solutions.
- **Overall Message**: Ambassador Transportation is a trustworthy and professional service provider for reliable, comfortable, and premium transportation solutions.

- **Issues with the Current Website**:
  - **Accessibility**: The site lacks proper contrast ratios and screen reader-friendly navigation, failing to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards.
  - **Speed**: Performance testing using [Pingdom Tools](https://tools.pingdom.com/) shows slow loading times, which may deter users.
  - **Design**: The layout is outdated and does not effectively highlight the key services offered.
  - **Responsiveness**: The site does not function well on smaller devices, leading to a poor user experience.
